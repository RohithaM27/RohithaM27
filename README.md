## 💡 About Me

Hi, I'm an Honors College student at George Mason University with a strong interest in product development and management. I love diving deep into market trends, and customer insights to identify opportunities for meaningful product feature enhancements. With experience in forming strategic partnerships across various product clients, I’ve developed a unique ability to connect brand campaigns and product solutions through mutual value creation. Whether it’s developing a product roadmap, analyzing customer sentiment, or designing engaging data visualizations, I aim to combine analytical skills with creative problem-solving skills to make a real impact.


My major has allowed me to strengthen my foundation in data analytics, sharpening my ability to collect, analyze, and visualize data to better understand business challenges. By leveraging these skills, I focus on drawing insights that support data-driven product decisions and lead to effective, user-centered solutions. My background blends product strategy, cross-functional collaboration, customer engagement, and market research with data analytics. I specialize in turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive business decisions and elevate product outcomes.
